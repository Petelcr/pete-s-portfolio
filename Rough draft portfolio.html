                        Hello to anyone who is reading this. <i>This is my practice portfolio</i> and hopefully, if this one comes out good I will create my actual portfolio. This website will be considered my rough draft. Once I feel accomplished with this one I will improve it and create an actual portfolio with all my accomplished websites.

                    <p>
                        My name is Pete Lucero and I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. Upon graduating Highschool I joined the United States Air Force. I spent 6 wonderful years in the military where I was able to travel the world. One of those Places was Okinawa Japan. There I met my Wife (Yuko), we have been married for 10 years now. After finishing my enlistment we moved to Las Vegas, where we spent 2 years and I worked as a contractor. Once we saved up enough money we moved to Fukui Japan. Fukui prefecture is a smaller prefecture, but it is my wife's home town. I have lived here for 5 years going on 6. I currently work as a automotive mechanic, but I am studying to become a programmer of some sort. Though my path has been a bit odd I am committed to learning and being the best version of myself for not only me but my wife also. Being a military wife she endured a lot, So its only right that I do my best to help make up for what she had to go through.
